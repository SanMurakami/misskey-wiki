**Moderators** are users who have permission to access the management information of their [instances](/instances). **Administrators (Admins)**, who have the same privilege as moderators, is also explained here.

Moderators and Admins use [Admin Page](/function/page_admin) of the instance to access management information.

As of now, the role of admin is given to someone only by direct manipulation of the database of the instance which the owner executes.
