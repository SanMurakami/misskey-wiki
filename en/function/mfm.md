**Markup language For Misskey (MFM)** is a Markdown-based syntax to format your notes, pages, or whatever.

A text with MFM should be displayed in the same way on any Misskey instance, while other ActivityPub-compatible services may display it differently since they do not understand MFM.

# Where you can use MFM
- [Note](/function/note)
  * Use "Copy Content" in the note menu and paste to Notepad to look at the MFM used in the note.
- Messages in [Talk](/function/messaging)
- [Page](/function/page)
- [Bio](/function/user_profile)
- Description of instances
- Notice from instances
